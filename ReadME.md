# 🚀 CS50x - 2025 - Career Readiness Re-Completion

### Goal

This project tracks my re-completion of CS50x (Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science).

The primary focus is **career readiness** and independent problem-solving. All problem sets will be completed without the use of AI Code Generation.

---

### Additional Challenges

This project is being completed, on my dedicated development server via SSH & not in the CS50x environment. I have manually added packages such as Submit50, and Check50.

## 🧭 CS50x Progress Tracker

This table includes metrics (Key Concepts, Effort, and Mentor Feedback) designed to track growth towards a professional Software Engineer level.
